        <p><strong>Aim:</strong> Design FA with ∑ = {0, 1} accepts even number of 0's and even number of 1's.</p>

        <div class="Theory">
            <h3>Theory:</h3>
            <p>States: To design the FA, you need to define the states. In this case, you'll have several states to represent different parity (even or odd) counts of '0's and '1's in the input string. We will define the states as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Q0: Initial state. Represents an even number of '0's and an even number of '1's encountered so far.</li>
                <li>Q1: Represents an odd number of '0's and an even number of '1's encountered so far.</li>
                <li>Q2: Represents an even number of '0's and an odd number of '1's encountered so far.</li>
                <li>Q3: Represents an odd number of '0's and an odd number of '1's encountered so far.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Transitions: Transitions define how the FA moves between states based on the input symbols ('0' and '1') and the desired behavior of the FA:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From Q0:</strong><br>
                    On input '0', transition to Q1 (to represent an odd number of '0's).<br>
                    On input '1', transition to Q2 (to represent an odd number of '1's).</li>
                <li><strong>From Q1:</strong><br>
                    On input '0', transition to Q0 (to return to even '0's).<br>
                    On input '1', transition to Q3 (to represent an odd number of '0's and '1's).</li>
                <li><strong>From Q2:</strong><br>
                    On input '0', transition to Q3 (to represent an odd number of '0's and '1's).<br>
                    On input '1', transition to Q0 (to return to even '1's).</li>
                <li><strong>From Q3:</strong><br>
                    On input '0', transition to Q2 (to return to even '0's).<br>
                    On input '1', transition to Q1 (to return to even '1's).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="Procedure">
            <h3>Procedure:</h3>
            <p>(using the simulator)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="test-cases">
            <h3>Test Cases:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Test Case 1:</strong> Even number of '0's and '1's<br>

                    <strong>Input:</strong> "10011"<br>

                <li><strong>Test Case 4:</strong> Empty String<br>
                    <strong>Input:</strong> ""<br>
                    <strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Accept (The empty string contains an even number of both '0's and '1's, which is 0 for both.)<br><br></li>
                <li><strong>Test Case 5:</strong> String with only '0's<br>

                <li><strong>Test Case 6:</strong> String with only '1's<br>
                    <strong>Input:</strong> "111"<br>
                    <strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Accept (The input string contains three '1's, which is even for '1's.)<br><br></li>
                <li><strong>Test Case 7:</strong> Alternating '0's and '1's<br>
                    <strong>Input:</strong> "010101"<br>
                    <strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Accept (The input string contains three '0's and three '1's, which is even for both.)<br><br></li>
                <li><strong>Test Case 8:</strong> Long string with even numbers<br>
                    <strong>Input:</strong> "00001111000011110000"<br>
                    <strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Accept (The input string contains an even number of '0's and an even number of '1's.)<br><br></li>
                <li><strong>Test Case 9:</strong> Single '0' and Single '1'<br>
                    <strong>Input:</strong> "01"<br>
                    <strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Reject (The input string contains an even number of '0's but an odd number of '1's.)<br><br></li>
                <li><strong>Test Case 10:</strong> String with spaces and other characters<br>
                    <strong>Input:</strong> "0 1 1 0"<br>
                    <strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Accept (The input string contains an even number of '0's and an even number of '1's, ignoring spaces and other characters.)<br><br></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These test cases cover various scenarios to ensure that the FA correctly accepts strings with an even number of '0's and an even number of '1's while rejecting strings that do not meet this criteria.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, we have designed a finite automaton (FA) that accepts strings with an even number of both '0's and '1's over the input alphabet ∑ = {0, 1}. The FA maintains four states, representing different parity combinations of '0's and '1's, and transitions between these states based on the input symbols. All states in this FA are accepting states because they represent even parity.</p>
