          <p class="theory-content">In the theory of computer science, several fundamental terms are essential to understanding the principles and concepts that underpin the field. One such term is "algorithm." An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem or completing a task in a finite number of steps. It serves as the foundation for computer programs, guiding the computer on how to perform specific tasks efficiently. Algorithms can range from simple calculations to complex problem-solving methods, and they are crucial in various areas such as sorting data, searching for information, and optimizing processes. Understanding algorithms is fundamental to designing efficient and effective computer programs.</p>

            <p class="theory-content">
              Finite Automata, a fundamental concept in the theory of computer science, are abstract machines used to model and analyze the behavior of systems with limited memory and processing capabilities. A Finite Automaton consists of a set of states, a set of input symbols, a transition function that defines the state transitions based on inputs, an initial state, and a set of accepting states. It operates by reading input symbols one at a time and transitioning between states according to the transition function. Finite Automata come in various types, such as Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) where each transition is uniquely determined by the current state and input symbol, and Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) where multiple transitions from a state with the same input symbol are allowed. Finite Automata are widely used in various applications, including lexical analysis in compiler design, pattern matching in text processing, and modeling simple real-world systems in computer science and engineering. Understanding Finite Automata is crucial for solving problems related to language recognition and formal language theory.</p>

            <h3>Pushdown Automata (PDA)</h3>
            <p class="theory-content">A Pushdown Automaton (PDA) is a theoretical model in computer science and automata theory that extends the capabilities of a finite automaton by incorporating an additional stack memory. PDAs are characterized by their ability to recognize context-free languages, which are more complex than regular languages. Unlike finite automata, PDAs can use a stack to store symbols, allowing them to remember and track information about the input string being processed. The PDA processes input symbols one at a time, using both the current state and the symbol at the top of the stack to determine its next move. It can perform three types of operations: push a symbol onto the stack, pop a symbol from the stack, or transition to a different state without changing the stack. PDAs play a fundamental role in formal language theory, parsing algorithms, and compiler design, as they provide insight into the structure of context-free grammars and their corresponding languages.</p>

            <h3>Turing Machines (TM)</h3>
            <p class="theory-content">Turing Machines (TMs) are fundamental theoretical constructs in computer science, devised by Alan Turing in the 1930s. They consist of an infinite tape divided into cells, where each cell can hold a symbol. The machine has a read/write head that moves left or right along the tape, interpreting symbols and transitioning between states according to a set of predefined rules. TMs serve as abstract models of computation, demonstrating the concept of algorithmic processes. They can perform various tasks, such as mathematical calculations, symbol manipulations, and decision-making. TMs play a pivotal role in the theory of computation, helping computer scientists understand the limits and capabilities of algorithms and computable functions, and forming the theoretical basis for modern computing systems.</p>
