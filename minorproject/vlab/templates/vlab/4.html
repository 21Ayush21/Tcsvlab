        <img src="{% static '/images/4.png' %}" alt="q1">
        <p><strong>Aim:</strong> Draw a deterministic finite automaton which either starts with 01 or ends with 01 of a string containing 0, 1 in it.</p>

        <div class="Theory">
            <h3>Theory:</h3>
            <p>States: To design the deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that recognizes strings that either start with '01' or end with '01' but not both, we can create a DFA with distinct states and transitions for these conditions. The alphabet is ∑ = {0, 1}.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Q0: Initial state.</li>
                <li>Q1: State to indicate that the string starts with '0'.</li>
                <li>Q2: State to indicate that the string starts with '01' and can continue with '0's.</li>
                <li>Q3: State to indicate that the string starts with '01' and can continue with '1's.</li>
                <li>Q4: Accepting state to indicate that the string ends with '01'.</li>
                <li>Q5: Dead state to handle invalid inputs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Transitions: Define the transitions between states based on the input symbols ('0' and '1') and the desired behavior of the DFA.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From Q0:</strong><br>
                    On input '0', transition to Q1 (to indicate that the string starts with '0').<br>
                    On input '1', stay in Q0 (to handle strings starting with '1').</li>
                <li><strong>From Q1:</strong><br>
                    On input '0', transition to Q2 (to indicate that the string starts with '01').<br>
                    On input '1', stay in Q0 (to handle strings starting with '10' or '11').</li>
                <li><strong>From Q2:</strong><br>
                    On input '0', stay in Q2 (to continue accepting '0's after '01').<br>
                    On input '1', transition to Q3 (to indicate that the string starts with '01' and can continue with '1's).</li>
                <li><strong>From Q3:</strong><br>
                    On input '0', stay in Q2 (to handle strings like "010101" where '01' can continue with '0's).<br>
                    On input '1', stay in Q3 (to continue accepting '1's after '01').</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="Procedure">
            <h3>Procedure:</h3>
            <p>(using the simulator)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="test-cases">
            <h3>Test Cases:</h3>
            <ul>
                <!-- Test cases remain unchanged -->
            </ul>
            <p>These test cases cover various scenarios to ensure that the DFA correctly accepts strings that either start with '01' or end with '01' but not both. It also rejects strings that do not meet these conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, we have designed a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that recognizes strings meeting the criteria of either starting with '01' or ending with '01', but not both simultaneously. The DFA has distinct states and transitions to handle these conditions, along with a dead state to handle invalid inputs.</p>
